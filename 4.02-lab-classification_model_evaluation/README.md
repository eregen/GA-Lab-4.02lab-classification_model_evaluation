We can sketch out the data science process as follows:
1. Define the problem.
2. Obtain the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Model the data.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Answer the problem.

In this lab, we're going to focus on steps exploring data, building models and evaluating the models we build.

Here we did no small ammount of data warngling, then used polynomial features and standard scalar to account for the complexities of human physiology.  Then we trained a logistic model to make predictions about CKS.
